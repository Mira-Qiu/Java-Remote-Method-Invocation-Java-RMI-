(RMI): Using RMI, write an application for a prototype opinion poll system. Assume that only one issue is being polled. Respondents may choose yes, or no. Write a client-server application to accept the votes, keep the tally (in memory), and provide the current counts to those who are interested.

For example, run the client three times as follows:


Enter port: What is your vote?[yes|no] : yes
Yes = 1; No = 0

Enter port: What is your vote?[yes|no] : no
Yes = 1; No = 1

Enter port: What is your vote?[yes|no] : no
Yes = 1; No = 2
